# Flame-and-smoke-detection
Part1 : For areas having high light intensity 

Smoke and fire detection using opencv,raspberry pi and flame sensor

Working:
The fire and smoke first detected by the camera then as per the algorithm  result will be checked by flame sensor and an automatic mail will be sent to the respective authority.
Advantages:-
Our system is highly accurate and fast.
Disadvantages: 
Low range of detection which can be increased by using high quality flame sensor or by using array of flame sensor.

Part 2 : For areas  having low light intensity for eg. (parking areas, not applicable in daylight )
Smoke and fire detection using opencv,raspberry pi

Working: The fire and smoke first detected by the camera then  as per the algorithm  and an automatic mail will be sent to the respective authority.
Advantages:-
Long range detection as per the previous code and which can be further increased by using higher resolution cameras.
Disadvantages: 
Not applicable for high light intensity areas.

Future Scope :
Both range and accuracy can be obtained using CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK.
